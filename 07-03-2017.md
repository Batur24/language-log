# Half Year
> 3rd, July

2017 has passed half, many commitments I made at the beginning of the year went slowly, or even not got started yet. I don't want to feel bad for myself. No matter how, I just stupidly feel optimistic. lol

Both Changsha and Shenzhen have been raining heavily these days. I had planed to go vacation after the project was done. But the planed had to get out of the table because of the bad weather. I went back to Shenzhen few days ago. I locked myself indoors to enjoy American TV on Netflix last weekend. What else could I do on the raining days? In addition, the movies are so great, I could not resist the temptation. :-)

I feel more motivated to learn English after coming back from the trip. There were many works to do in Changsha compared here in Shenzhen, but still it's a way to get out of the mundane life and relax for a while.
