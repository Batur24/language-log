# Toastmasters

I went back to hometown on the weekend, didn't do much English learning. Last
night, I went to Toastmasters in Lenovo building. The topic is food. The
activity was well organigized. Many people in the group can speak fluent English
and can give a good speech. I feel great being with these intelligent people 
everytime I go there. One of the members told that it's important to slow down
on the way of learning a language, don't push ourselves too hard. I agree with
her. I used to go that way. The expection is high, the disappointment is high
too when task could not be finished. And disappointment can drive us give up.

I am listening the audio of `Born a Crime`, Trevor Noah speaks it. I could get
almost all of the content since I listened part I had read . Actually, I just 
finished 1/3 of the book. I hope I could finish it this week.
