# First Post

My friend Batman encouraged me to begin language log here. I actually don't have courage to make commitment of anything. I fear that I will have a passionate beginning but end up giving it up like always. I have hesitated for days. Now I am going to try again. No matter how far I can go, I think it'll be very beneficial. 

## Apps
Currently I am using two mobile apps to help my English, 'Fluent English Speaking' and 'BaiCiZhan'. FES for spoken English, which I have used it for more than two years. BCZ, about one year experience, for building vocabulary. I am not sure how long will I keep using them, I used to stop using them for weeks.

## Friends
I have many passionate friends. Many are here in Shenzhen, some are friends I make on the Internet. I get motivation every time I feel lazy. We support each other to go further. I won't go so far without them. I am really grateful.

## Entertainment
I am a big fan of American TV shows. But now I don't spend as much time on it as before, since I have a lot of work to do. Now I am watching <The fosters> on Netflix. I can watch it without Chinese subtitles, it's a big improvement for me. I hope I could watch it without English subtitles one day. That's my goal.
I still feel frustrated when I read long articles, it's stressful to read good articles on NY times. I know those articles are great, I really want to read them. But one article may cost me more than an hour, and it's painful. 

## Work
I am a programmer in China. I don't have chance to speak English on my work, but I do use it frequently for searching information on Google. I would contribute more in open source if my English become better. It's a big motivation for me to learn English.

Batman used to encourage me to run, and now running become my hobby. Why won't it be a hobby for me writing here this time?
