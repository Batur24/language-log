# Freelance Work

I told my boss that I was ready to quit. That is an easy decision, I planed to
go for a long time. However, I had planed to find another job, want to have
awesome colleagus working together. Recently, a friend introduced me a part-time
job, I began to think of freelance work seriously. I think it's worth trying.
My friend Sergy had began his freelance work a year ago. He told me it's not
easy, and gave me many suggestions. Previously, I also applied some proposals on
upwork. I have little confidence for my English and communication. And that is
what I need to improve. Discipline is the most challenable thing for me. I am 
bad at scheduling my time, hope that I could make use of my time and explore new
things I am interested in. But I need to find enough work to survive myself, and
also for offering JuanJuan a better life. :P
