In any situation, small things we do can reflect who we are.
But in extreme condition, when we are under pressure or face a challenge or in a difficult situaion
the attitude we have, the decision we make, the way we go can define who we really are.
This time, I want to talk about a book by French writer Camus and his philosophy.
What I learn from Camus can help me see things differently, even in extreme condition

Humble and Contemptuous

Imagine you're in a plague disease city. The diease just began to spread, people are getting ill, 
and a couple of people die off every day. The government sealed the city few days ago, 
in afraid of the disease to spread.
You're still healthy, but you cannot leave this city without authorities permission. You cannot connect
to the outside world via phone or Internet, because it will cause panic in a whole country. Thousands of 
people like you are waiting to get affected by the disease, and die desperately. 
what would you do if you're in this situation?
+ pray to God
+ try everything possible to escape this city
+ enjoy the rest life, do something you haven't done before, even something considered abnomal or illegal
+ help fight against the disease even though very little chance to win

The book called <Plague> written by French philosopher Camus described such kind situation. People are getting
panic at the begining, some people are using illegal ways to escape the city like we know in film Tinatic.
Some people use this disease
to warn people that it's God's punishment for people don't follow the God. Some are afraid of the terrible
symptoms and decide to commit suicide. However, some people begin to make a medical team to fight against the
epidemic. 

A courageous and talented doctor Rieux lead this medical team, with his leadership and hard working, 
many people joined the team, including a man, Galang. He's not very smart, but 
very kind, and had a naive dream to think of some good sentences for his novelty, which is just
severl sentences.
He's a very normal guy, doing some repeated works, making his little contribution. 
Finnally the plague disease was defeated. What pondered me most is the author said,
if this story really needs a hero, Instead of doctor Rieux, it's this simple man Galang.

Let heroism comes back to its second position where it should be. What does that mean? 
It's people ranks first. Humble, be a part of integer people.
Another view made me think a lot is, don't think over highly of Good deeds, it's equivalent to praise evil indirectly.
Almost all of the evil in the world is caused by ignorance, and we all are ignorant in a way.


If you asked me, what would I do if I were in that situation? To be honest, 
I don't know. But I hope I could have the courage to join
the medical team, fight against the desease no matter what. 

Let me tell you another story.

Sisyphus was a king of Greek mythology. He cheated God to escape death. After beging caught, Sisyphus was
punishied to push a rock up a mountain, upon reaching the top, the rock would roll down again, leaving 
Sisphus to start over. 
The book <The Mytho of Sisyphus> by Camus, he argued that workers in the factory, what they repeatedly do
on assembly line, or people like us working in the office day after day, 
is no difference than Sisyphus in a way. Most of us
cannot escape this destiny. But Camus said that Sisyphus is in happiness. Because he knew what's doing
and contempt these Gods.
Only when we all consciously know our situation, still keep going ahead, contempt "the God" in our life,
we are in happiness
















Some people have natual kindness, and strong willpower. I don't have. I realized that I have to be conscious and
alerted, otherways, I may make decisions driven by the fear and greedy.
I don't know how to have a strong willpower, but after I read Camus philosophy book <The Myth of Sisyphus>, I think I am on the
way to building my willpower.



Now let's imagine another situaion.
If you are in an ATM, and the cash can be withdrawn for whatever number you input, what would you do?
+ Will you call the bank support phone and tell them what happened?
+ Take as much money as you could?
This is the real case happened in Guangzhou, 2006. Xu, who withdraw 170 thousand from malfunctional ATM, was
sentenced to 5 years in prison. I had talked with my Dad about this, he said if he were in that situation,
where money can just be taken away so easily, he honestly said that he could not guntantee he won't do that.
If you asked me again, To be honest, I don't know what I would do.
I hope I could resisit this temptation. Calm, lead a peaceful life.
