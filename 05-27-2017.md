I haven't updated my English log here for a while. I am still using 英语流利说 and 百词斩 to practice my spoken English and build my vocabulary every day. Recently, I begin to read Atlantic https://www.theatlantic.com articles, they are great! Though there are many new words for me, I can enjoy the article without clearly understanding these new words. I am not sure if I should write down these new words, it seems a lot of work to do, I think I should give it a try.

A while ago, I talked to a friend, he suggested me to think about study or work in a foreign country, it'll be a big motivation for learning learning English. I used to eager to go abroad, but somehow I lost my motivation. 

I went to English salon holding by a library here last night. I have been absent for weeks, grad that I attended and learned some English poem knowledge last night.
