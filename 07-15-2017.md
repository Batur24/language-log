# Toastmasters

I've been attended two Toastmasters activities this week. Many excellent people
were out there. Standing in front of people to give a speech is very different
from chatting with friends, let alone using English. The English these people 
spoke were not perfect, you could spot mistakes during their speech. But their 
confidence and courages really inspired me. The process of preparing an English
speech can be very helpful, I think. You have to repeat many many times before
going to the stage, and repeat is very important for language learning.

I have finished half book of `Born a Crime`. I read it and listen the audio book
at the same time. And just now, I watched Trevor Noah's `the daily show`. Trevor
is so cool! Now one of my goals is going to his show as a guest, lol.

My friend and I agreed that storytelling is very hard when we chatted after a
toastmaster telling a story. Even in native language, many people could not tell
a good story. Telling a story is a gift, but I think it can also be trained.
When I was reading `Born a Crime` the other day, I thought I could tell the
story of Trevor Noah to my friends. "I want to share them with these amazing
stories", I thought. I don't think I could attract them because of my poor
storytelling skill, but it's the process of training.

I think I could retell the stories here.
