# How Money Works Explain

Before money was used, people simply bartered. Person one gave person two some
eggs, and received, let's say wood in return. But for this transaction happen.
Person one has to want wood, person two has to want eggs. If person one doesn't
want wood, and want a knife instead. Then person two has to first find person
three, who is willing to give his knife for his wood, and then give the knife
to person one, so thtat he can receive person's eggs. This is just way too
complicated. Therefore, a common denominator was required, something desirable
that everyone accepts, to act as a medium of exchange, that's what money
basically is. A widely accepted medium of exchange. People simply trade using 
money, and don't have to resort to barter. Some community use cocoa seeds 
as money, other communities use seashells, others cattle and so on. Nowadays,
each country simply has its own currency. Let's assume seashells are used money.
This means, instead of bartering, person two pays person one, let's say two 
seashells for example. Person one decides he needs knife from person three, he
pays him seashells as well. Because that is what everyone in community use this.
