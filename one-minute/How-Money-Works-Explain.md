# How Money Works Explain

Before money was used, people simply bardered. Person one gives person two some
eggs, and receive, let's say wood in return. But for this transction happen.
Person one has to want wood, person two has to want eggs. If person one doesn't
want wood, and want knife instead. Then person two has to first find person
three, who is willing to give him knife for his wood, and then give the knife
person one, so then he can receive person's eggs. This is just way too
complicated. Therefore, a common xxx was required, something desirable that
everyone accepts, to act as intermediating exchange, that's what money basically
is. A widely accept medium exchange. People simply trade using money, and don't
have to resolve to barder. Some community use cocoa seeds as money, other
communities use seashells, others' cattle and so on. Nowadays, each country
simply has its own currency. Let's assume seashells are used money. This means,
instead of bardering, person two pays person one, let's say two seashells for
example. Person one decides he needs knife from person three, he pays him
seashells as well. Because that is what everyone in community use this.
