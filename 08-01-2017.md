# Fang's Speech

I am a big fan of Fang. He has a huge influence on me, from his science books as
well as his poem. I listened his podcast tonight, and I recommended his podcast
to Batman. And then I remembered he had given English speech publicly when he
accepted awards of Nature John Maddox Prize and ACFE. So I found them on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmoxhH8MGV8).

His English has strong Chinese accent. Batman said he could not understand his
English without subtitles. But actually the audience all understood him and 
laughed loudly during his speech.

I think I should pay more attention on reading and writing, rather than making
great effort to make my spoken English sound more native.
