# New Friends

I joined ship toastmaster this month, finished my CC1 two weeks ago. Last night, the ex-president and vice president of membership trained new members knowledge about the history, the mission, everything we need to know about toastmaster. Ex-president Zizheng is a very funny man, he's very hilarious and charming. VPM Sean is very gentleman, he's kind and patient to clarify our confusion. They empowered us to begin the journey we sailors are destined to go. It was a very helpful night.

There are many awesome poeple in the ship toastmaster club. It's my hornor to join this club, I think I could learn a lot from these passionate people. Many people come to this club for English learning, but it's a club for improving communication skills and leadership. Like Zizheng had said, we could be inspired by others to learn English, but English learning is a very personal thing. And in my opinion, communication skills and leadership are more important in workplace.
