# Breaking Bad
> 5th, July

When reading other people's language log, I can clearly see how poor my writing is. For a long time, I want to improve my writing skill. I had knew the importance of writing since I was in university. Like many other skills, writing asks for numerous practices. I am not as consistent as I should be, I tend to give up easily. In my mind, I didn't give them up, I just "leave them in the future". I know this is an excuse, but knowing that I will still work on them one day, not only makes me feel better, but it also reminds me from time to time.

Last night, I browsed around the Netflix, somehow I clicked `Breaking Bad` again. I haven't watched it for several months. It's a great TV show, I fear that I may get addicted to it, so I avoided clicking it when I was free. But last night I did, and watched three episodes in row. They were S3E6-S3E8. I could enjoy them with only English subtitles only, which I am proud of :-), but I am not sure if watching them will help my English learning. I could guess the meaning of new words based on the context, or simply ignore them and follow the plot. However, I won't remember any new words after watching them. Maybe it will help me get familiar with them, and will make me remember them easier in the future. I doubt it :'(  

Anyway, I think I may keep watching `Breaking Bad`, it's so awesome!

Besides Hank's post, I decide to follow another post, [Systematiker's](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2764) on the forum. I was wondering why this forum is so old-fashion, and the new post should be in the front page like twitter so that people who want to follow the update can easily catch. And when people leave messages on author's post, it should have email reminder. These are good features, but I try to guess it's because the owner of this site want to keep it simple, and focus the language itself.
