# Breaking Bad
> 5th, July

When reading other people's language log, I can clearly see how poor my writing is. For a long time, I want to improve my writing skill. I had knew the importance of writing since I was in univeristy. Like many other skills, writing asks for numerous practices. I am not as consistent as I should be, I tend to give up easily. In my mind, I didn't give them up, I just "leave them in the future". I know this is an execuse, but knowing that I will still work on them one day, not only makes me feel better, but it also reminds me from time to time.

Last night, I browsed around the Netflix, somehow I clicked <Breaking Bad> again. I haven't watched it for several months. It's a great TV show, I fear that I may get addicted to it, so I avoided clicking it when I was free. But last night I did, and watched three episodes in row. They were S3E6-S3E8. I could enjoy them with only English substitles only, which I am proud of :-), but I am not sure if watching them will helpe my English. I could guess the meaning of some words based on the context, or ignore them and follow the plot. However, I won't remember any new words. Maybe it will help me get familiar with them, and will help to remember them in the future. I doubt it :'(  Even though, I think I may keep watching <Breaking Bad>, it's so awesome!
