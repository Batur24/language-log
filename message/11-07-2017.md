Hi, 阿波!

Your Mandarin is really impressive, I have to say it again. As I know, people 
who learn Mandarin consider characters is a big challenge, I've heard that 
people can speak fluent Mandarin without learning characters. So you will
definitely surprise every Chinese when they realize you can write so well. 
Honestly, I am poor at writing Chinese characters now, I seldom write notes
because all the stuffs I can do on computer or on phone.

It's my first time to encounter`学料`, but I could easily guess that it means
`学习资料`. There's little differences between Taiwan Mandarin and mainland 
Mandarin. I agree your opinion that there are many not so good materials of 
English, and abundant resources can distract learners. 

I think friendly should translate into "友好", and enthusiastic can be "热情".

Doris and I are friends, I actually attended the salon more often than her. But
I was busy recently and absent for weeks now. The salon is a good place for us
to practice English. It's hosted by a library, the guests are native speakers
or English teachers. Different guests have different teaching styles, but 
overall they encourage us to chat in English. Through this salon, I met many 
English learners like Doris, they are dilligent and nice. We encourage and 
support each other.

I speak Cantonese not very often in daily life, Shenzhen is a city of
immigration. So even it's in Guangdong and near HongKong, not so many people
speak Cantonese. My spoken Cantonese is just so so, I think I just don't
practice enough. There are many TV shows or movies spoken by Cantonese, but I
 seldom watch them.

阿波, do you have friends who learn Mandarin in your daily life? What's your
goal of Mandarin? Speaking fluently, reading without obstacles?

The Chinese below is not exactly the same as English. 
I don't write Chinese regularly, so if you found my mistakes, don't be surprised
and tell me. :-)

    

你好，阿波！

我要再说一遍, 你的普通话真的很棒. 我听说汉字非常难学， 很多学习中文的外国人可以
讲一口流利的中文，但是他们也许并不认识汉字. 我想如果你把你的中文给每个中国人看，
他们绝对会惊呆的。其实，我现在很少写字，因为用电脑和手机就可以了。

我以前没有看到过“学料”这个词，但是很明显这是“学习资料”。台湾普通话和大陆的普通话
还是有一点点的区别。丰富的英语资料有不好的一面，就像你说的，很多资料质量并不是很
高。而且资料多，也让人容易分心。

我和Doris是现实中的朋友，我经常参加沙龙。不过前段时间我比较忙，所以有几个星期没有去了。
这个沙龙是一个图书馆主办的，很不错。嘉宾一般都是外国人或者英语老师。不同的嘉宾有
不同的方式，总体上来说，他们鼓励我们开口讲。我在这里认识了很多朋友，他们都很棒，
我们经常一起练习英语。

我在日常生活中并不经常讲粤语。虽然深圳在广东省，靠近香港，但是这是一个移民城市，
并没有很多人讲粤语。因为我比较少讲，所以我的粤语很一般。
