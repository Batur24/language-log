I am still on my bussiness in Changsha. It's been more than 10 days. I am kind of missing SZ. I didn't recite new words and parctice spoken English like I do in Shenzhen. It's bad to break schedule. 

I read articles on Quora just now. It's so fun to read all kinds of stories. Sometimes I have already forgotten the joy I used to enjoy. There are so many useful resource that I can make use of. It's just too hard to do them consistently.
