# Intensive Listening

I read an article that explains the importance of intensive listening for
learning a language. The argument is very persuasive. The way is to listen the 
short audio/video repeatedly, and write down every word you heard. Knowing the
gist of the content is not enough, I think I should try to know every word of 
the content. It is hard, definitely. But through this way, I could push myself 
pay more attention to the construct of sentences, the tiny difference of grammar
usage, etc. I browsed through the Youtube, then I found this video list,
[Learn Economics in One minute](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhICud5IUwVhK85aHuhrY3-iUwq6eOC6L) 
It's very suitable for me, and I could learn some economic knowledge too. 
Two birds one stone, awesome! I would download the video as mp3 audio, listen to
it repeatedly. And write down the content, listen again to correct the error.
And later to compare the subtitles. There is no official subtitle available, but
I found the auto-subtitle by Youtube is great.
