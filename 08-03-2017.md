# CS162

Zuckerberg had given a speech in Harward University commencement recently. He 
mentioned a course called CS121. I heard such odd computer science course
names several times. Out of curiosity, Last night I searched it on the Youtube.
Casually glanced over, I found CS162 of UC Berkeley. That was operating system
course. After watching about 40 minutes, I got bored.

MOOC, Massive Open Online Course, is such a wonderful idea. I still remembered
when I read the article about MOOC before 2015, I was very excited. I can't help
imagining learning great courses from top universities of the world. I 
registered many courses, after 2 years passed, I didn't finish one. It was
frustrating. Discipline is hard. Though it's very difficult, I am optimistic
about online education, it is the future.

Not sure if I will continue CS162, but surely I will make use of the online
resources to improve myself.
