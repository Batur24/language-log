A friend told me that she doesn't know what to do in the future. She's a student in the univeristy, the future seems far away from current life. I had exactly same situation five years ago when I was in the univeristy. Time flies, it seemed the university life was just few days ago.

I was lost, and began trying new stuffs. From volunteer, hardware engineer, programmer, and now a freelancer. Every time I start a new role, I am panic. Yeah, I am anxious, worried and doubt it's a right decision or not. Though it's uncomfortable, I still have to do. If that's not my role, I have to find where my role is. It's my life, I have to explore. She told me that if she began new things, what's the meaning of past years, they are all wasted. No, it's a totally wrong assumption.

Why do you read? Most of the books seems like not useful in daily life. I had read a question on Quora, one answer wrote, reading is like eating, it becomes the muscle of our body, we grow up, become strong. The exploration of life is similar, all we do, no matter failure or success, it becomes a part of our life, we become stronger, our life become colorful.

I may fail, but it will not stop me from going ahead. I am confident. I can accept failure.
