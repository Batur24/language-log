# Omelette
> 4th, July

I cooked myself omelette this morning. It took me several minutes to enjoy this simple yet delicious food. Alina took me her tea from her hometown, now I am enjoying it. It's a good start of a day with breakfast and tea.

I read [Hank's Adventure in Spanish](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1833) on language learners forum. I quite enjoyed reading his posts. To read other people's language log can help my English learning for both methods and motivation.

I uploaded another [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmKR_TYzQy0) on youtube. I can see the technique of editing video is quite useful, I may try to learn it when I have free time. Batman suggested I could try speech shadowing, I don't think I have talent for it.
