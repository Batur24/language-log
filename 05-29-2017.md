# Apartheid

> 29th, May

I read Bill Gate's blog today. After reading this [blog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2017), I found the book [Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime?ac=1&from_search=true). I have never watched Trevor Noah show before, but I read sever pages, and I think it's my dish. So I am going to read it. And I plan to take some new words I encounter. 

In the eastern of China, we don't have much diverse culture. Han is the absolutely majority. I have watched some movies about apartheid and racism. This kind of movie always make me think deeply. Sometimes I would think, what if I were in their positions, what could I do? Will I be different from them?

Haowei and I went running in the park tonight. We ran pretty fast, I felt exhausted. There should be three days off for the Dragon Boat festival. But because of the company's policy, I have to work this weekend. And we can have a rest only on Dragon Boat day.
