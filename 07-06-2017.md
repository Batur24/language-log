# Phrase

I watched `Ricky and Morty` two episodes. This is a quite interesting cartoon TV show. I think I just spent too much time on videos. The book, Trevor Noah's `Born a Crime`, I have only gone through half after a month passed away.

I found phrase is quite hard to learn. For instance, The phrase `keep up the good work` occured to me several times when I read language logs here. I can understand it means keep on doing the good work, but I won't use `keep up` myself, and even though I aware it know, I probably won't use it in the future either. That is kind of frustrating. I learned other phrases I was not familiar with like `set someone off`, `spousal unit`. I knew that if I could use such phrases, my English would be more nature.
