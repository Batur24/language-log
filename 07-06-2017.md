# Phrase

I watched several episodes of `Ricky and Morty`. This is a quite interesting cartoon TV show. I think I just spent too much time on videos. The book, Trevor Noah's `Born a Crime`, I have only gone through half after a month passed away. I should have spent more time with my kindle.

I found phrase is quite hard to master. For instance, The phrase `keep up the good work` occurred to me several times when I read language logs here. I can understand that it means keep on doing the good work, but I know that I won't use `keep up` myself, and even though I aware it now, I probably won't use it in the future either. That is kind of frustrating. Repeat is really important when it comes to language. I learned other phrases I was not familiar with like `set someone off`, `spousal unit` today. I knew that if I could use phrases like these, my English would sound like more nature.

I try to write English as often as possible, even though I don't have things to say sometimes, and maybe it's not related to English learning. Language should be a tool to express ideas, a window to explore another culture, a way to enjoy other brilliant people's work. So I will use English to write down whatever I think of.
