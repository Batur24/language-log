# Seinfeld

> 10th, May - 13th, May

I have watched season one of \<Seinfeld\>, and watching season two now. I quite enjoy watching them. It seems that I could watch the same episode again and agiain, and don't feel bored at all. 

When reciting words on the app, I could find the correct answer, but these words are still unfamiliar to me. I guess if I read them on the article, I could have deeper impression.

Doris has already begun writing log here, and Batman promised me that he's going to write. Adrianslont told me that my name is a volcano and a lake in Indonesia, I hope that I could go there one day.
I have never seen any volcano before, what does it feel if I see them in person? Looking forward to exploring the world in the future.
