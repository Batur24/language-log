# Yang's Interview

I watched an interview of Yang Zhenning, the Chinese Noble prize laureate. When
he and another Chinese physicist got the Noble Prize in 1957, he was still 
Chinese. In 1964, he became American citizen after staying in the US about 20
years. But in 2015, he gave up American nationality, and became a Chinese citizen
again. Now he's teaching physics in Tsinghua University.

His interview was quiet instructive. He compared the different education system
between China and the US. He said young people should get the education in China
before graduate university. Students in China are well trained, because they do
a lot of exercises than counterparts in The US, While US can offer creative and
innovative environment, which is very rare in China. During the interview,
professor Yang told some anecdotes of famous scientists, including Einstein and
Fermi.

Professor Yang's English is great, I wanted to watch his video at the beginning
because I wanted to compare his English to Fang's English. It seems that Fang is
lack of language talent. lol
