# Marathon

Today I finished my second marathons in 2017. After quitting job and become a freelancer, my life is a bit messy. I am not as organized as before. Both English learning and running become on and off. Tonight, Sergy and I had a good chat, he told me that it's hard to be self-discipline, I will get better rewards in many different ways. And he said I am building my personality. I am very appreciated and grateful. Sergy aways can inspire me to keep going. Now I am about to go to Philipines. To be honest, I don't quite sure what will happen there. And I guess I am making a stupid decision to leave Shenzhen. But somehow it attracts me. I will still go even I may lose a lot of opportunities here.
